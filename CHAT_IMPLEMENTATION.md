## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── chat/
│       ├── CreateGroupModal.jsx     # Group creation modal
│       ├── JoinCallModal.jsx        # Call joining interface
│       └── ChatNotificationBadge.jsx # Unread count badge
├── contexts/
│   └── ChatContext.jsx             # Global chat state management
├── services/
│   └── chatService.js              # Firebase chat operations
├── pages/
│   └── Chat.jsx                    # Main chat interface
└── firebase.js                     # Firebase configuration
```

### Context Architecture
The `ChatContext` provides:
- Global state management for groups, messages, and notifications
- Real-time Firebase listeners
- Centralized chat operations
- Unread message tracking

### Firebase Collections
```javascript
// Groups collection
groups: {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  type: 'project' | 'custom',
  members: string[],
  createdBy: string,
  isPrivate: boolean,
  lastMessage: object,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Messages collection
messages: {
  id: string,
  groupId: string,
  senderId: string,
  senderName: string,
  senderAvatar: string,
  text: string,
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'file',
  fileData: object,
  reactions: object,
  timestamp: timestamp,
  edited: boolean
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Project Integration
When a project is created in `ProjectsNew.jsx`:
1. Project is created in local state
2. `chatService.createProjectGroup()` is called
3. A chat group is automatically created with project details
4. Group members initially include the project creator

#### Authentication Integration
- Uses `react-firebase-hooks` for auth state
- Chat context automatically connects/disconnects based on auth state
- User info is automatically included in messages

## Usage

### Basic Chat Usage
1. Navigate to `/chat` page
2. Select a group from the sidebar
3. Type messages in the input field
4. Use attachment buttons for files/images
5. Click on messages to add reactions

### Creating Groups
1. Click the "+" button in chat sidebar
2. Fill in group name and description
3. Add members by email
4. Set privacy preferences
5. Click "Create Group"

### File Sharing
1. Click the paperclip icon for general files
2. Click the image icon for images
3. Files are uploaded to Firebase Storage
4. Download links are generated automatically

### Joining Calls (Future Implementation)
1. Click the phone/video icon in chat header
2. Configure audio/video preferences
3. Share call link with participants
4. Click "Join Call" to connect

## Configuration

### Firebase Setup
Ensure these Firebase services are enabled:
- **Firestore**: For real-time messaging
- **Storage**: For file uploads
- **Authentication**: For user management

### Required Environment Variables
All Firebase config is already included in `firebase.js`

### Dependencies Added
- `firebase`: Core Firebase SDK
- `react-firebase-hooks`: React hooks for Firebase
- File upload handling built-in

## Future Enhancements

### WebRTC Integration
The call system is designed to integrate with:
- **Agora SDK**: For production-grade video calling
- **Socket.io**: For WebSocket-based real-time features
- **WebRTC**: For peer-to-peer communication

### Advanced Features
- Message threading and replies
- Message search and filtering
- Voice messages
- Screen sharing in calls
- Group video calls
- Message encryption
- Online status indicators
- Message read receipts

### Performance Optimizations
- Message pagination for large groups
- Lazy loading of chat history
- File compression for uploads
- CDN integration for file serving

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Messages not appearing**: Check Firebase Firestore rules
2. **File upload fails**: Verify Firebase Storage configuration
3. **Auth issues**: Ensure Firebase Auth is properly configured
4. **Real-time not working**: Check network connectivity and Firestore listeners

### Development Tips
1. Use Firebase Emulator for local development
2. Monitor Firestore usage to avoid quota limits
3. Implement proper error boundaries
4. Test with multiple users/devices
5. Use React DevTools to debug context state

## Security Considerations

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Example security rules (implement in Firebase Console)
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Groups - only members can read/write
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
    }
    
    // Messages - only group members can read/write
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in get(/databases/{database}/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.members;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Security Rules
```javascript
// Example storage rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /chat-files/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a production-ready chat system with room for future enhancements and integrations.
